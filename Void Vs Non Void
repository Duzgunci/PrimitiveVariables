Generally, you youse non-void methods when you need to get something from the object.

public List<Account> getAssocAccounts(Set<Id> accIds)
{
  return [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id IN: accIds];
}

In this case, we are passing a set of ids into this method because we need to get associated accounts with those ids.
 
public void setAssocAccounts(Set<Id> accIds)
{
  myAccountList = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id IN: accIds];
}
 In this instance, we just need to do an action upon something but we dont need to return the results to the caller.
